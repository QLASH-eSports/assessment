# Onboarding Screen Exercise

Welcome to the onboarding screen exercise for our React Native developer position! In this exercise, you will be implementing the logic and UI for an onboarding screen in our existing React Native project.


This will open up the Expo Developer Tools in your default web browser. From here, you can run the project on your iOS or Android device using the Expo Client app or an emulator.

## Task description

Your task is to implement the logic and UI for an onboarding screen in our React Native project using Expo Router. The onboarding screen should consist of:

- A welcome message or heading
- 2-4 screens that users can swipe through, each with a short message or tip about the app's features or how to use it
- A call-to-action button that takes the user to the app's main screen

You can find the code for the onboarding screen in the `app/onboarding/signup.tsx` file. Your task is to implement the missing functionality and UI components to make the onboarding screen work as described above.

Feel free to use any third-party libraries or tools you feel comfortable with to complete the task. (like, react-hook-form or zod, or even react-native-paper for the UI)

## Submission

Once you have completed the task, please submit your solution as a pull request to this repository. In your pull request, please include a brief description of the changes you made and any notes or comments you want to share about your implementation.

We will review your submission and get back to you as soon as possible.

Good luck, and happy coding!
